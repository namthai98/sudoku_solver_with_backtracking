- What is sudoku ?
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. 
In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, 
and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

- Introduction
This project build a sudoku basic game with 9x9 grid. The grid will create random.
Then user will try to guess the value of each cell.
Using backtracking algorithm to check the result.
Build GUI with pygame module in python.
